App name: it should easy to spell and pronounce, unique, and descriptive, fitting within the length limits (50 characters for iOS, 30 for Android)
Keywords: this is only applicable to Apple, and it’s an extra space to specify the search terms relevant to your app for the app meta data
Icon: use a clear color palette, avoid using lots of small details, and opt in for contrasting colors and a simple, clear concept
Screenshots: make sure to use all five screenshots and to leverage caption texts to tell a story and highlight benefits, including the app design
Description: focus on the first three lines (before the ‘More…’ link) to clearly convey the key points, use bullet lists, and have a call to action
