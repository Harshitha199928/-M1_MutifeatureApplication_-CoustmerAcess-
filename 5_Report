The practical selection of a preferred AM classification requires the identification of synergies between the product design requirements and 
the techno-economic attributes of the AM technology under consideration.4 For example, the specific design requirements may necessitate 
colour materials to represent the final product aesthetics; multiple materials to allow complex functional outcomes; mechanically 
robust materials to allow efficient load bearing; and, physical size and tolerance requirements for form-and-fit requirements. Furthermore,
the intended AM component will have a series of economic requirements associated with the required production volume and allowable unit-cost.
