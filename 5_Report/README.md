 # Best methods followed
 - Used functions to decrease dependency on main function
 - Used decision statements  to execute the commands one bye one and follow the flow.
 - Printf statements have been placed only wherever necessary to avoid confusions
 - Created header file so that the fuctions can be used else where ever required without any difficulty
